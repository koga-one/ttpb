# Story
facing artistic struggles such as art-block, she decides to finish her last project with everything she got, creating an interactive artwork that directly correlates with the whole meteor news and how it escalated during the last 365 days (her art will be shown in the last days before the impact).
Her story will entangle with Jessie's and Nicolas', as they travel around the world. They'll eventually decide and help her with the final touches of her "goodbye" project.
