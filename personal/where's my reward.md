#PERSONAL #sad

in the backstage, alone
helping,
trying my best.

it truly hurts to see them so happy
why? wasn't i the one responsible for this?
why can't i share some of the happiness that i gave them? 

all these years, the reason for my constant and neverending will to help others
was it because i felt empty this whole time?
perhaps, just perhaps
all i needed this whole time
was someone to say
"i know what you're doing"
"i'm proud of you"
"i'm with you"
"you're not alone"
