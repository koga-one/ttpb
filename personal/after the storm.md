#sad #poem

after the storm passes 1
and the sun comes back 9
and my mind clears out t
i suddenly realize the h
meaning of my thoughts 
perhaps, perhaps i can f
be honest and tell her l
everything i've always o
wanted to share, maybe o
maybe, just maybe, she r
might understand these __
things i've been trying c
to deal with for so long a
by myself. maybe she will r
help me and comfort me for e
hours, whispering in my ear f
i am here for you, don't cry u
you're not alone anymore, ok? l
whatever happens, just please, !
don't jump, don't ever give up. =|
