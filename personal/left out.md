why do i always bring people together, just for me to slowly drift away from them?

why do i feel so left out, so useless, so meaningless, so forgettable, so ephemeral, so...
unloved?

why does it seem that the people i care the most don't reciprocate?

do they even care about me?

**why do i feel like i'm always a bother, or that i'm always different**

**why do i feel forced to play the fun and crazy persona to be recognized?**

how can i be so invisible again and again and again

without fail

why do i even try? why do i even care? [[where's my reward]]?

[[i'm just like you]]
