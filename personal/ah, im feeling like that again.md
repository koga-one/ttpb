#sad

i can't turn off my brain
for some reason, nothing's good enough today
they're too busy with their own lives
which is how it is supposed to happen
but why am i stuck
while everything moves?

am i the problem? am i doing something wrong? what should i do?

why am i feeling empty

why do i feel [[left out]]?
