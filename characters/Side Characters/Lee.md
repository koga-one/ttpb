# bio
Lee is a chinese factory worker that lost his parents when he was a kid. his parents were activists fighting against a corruption scheme in the same company Lee currently works at. they were eventually killed in front of him by a hired assassin, presumably hired by the company higher-ups. during all this time, he was structuring a revenge plan that would still take some time to initiate. however, after the Impact news spread out to more places and the sudden death of the CEO, he decides to speed up the process and start the strike right away.
